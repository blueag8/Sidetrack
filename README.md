## About
This website is for the flute and guitar duo “Sidetrack” to showcase their music
and publicise their availability to perform at events. Users can also contact the duo
to enquire about availability or upcoming performances. 

## UX

The duo’s primary target audiences are their “family, friends and other fans” 
who wish to keep abreast of our gigs, past and upcoming. 
They would like to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events
such as weddings, funerals and dinner parties.


They wish to include:

- Photos of performances
- Some video clips
- Some audio clips to demonstrate their diversity of repertoire
- A list of current repertoires
- An option to promote additions to the repertoire

In addition, the website should promote live music in Port Adelaide, in particular

- The Railway Hotel – Port Adelaide
    www.railwayhotelportadelaide.com/
- Michonne Wine Bar: Michonne - Reds, Whites and Bites
    www.michonne.com.au/

### Difficulties/issues encountered

1. Background Image disappearing and not scaling 
2. Carousel animation jumping
3. Social Media links not lining up
4. Images not responding when change in viewport ie desktop to mobile view
5. After feedback from a fellow student It Was pointed out that it was not obvious
  to the user when a page change had occured without seeing the URL or 
  scrolling down the page.
6. Animation causing page to jump

#### Solutions

1. Removed the background image filepath from the Css Style sheet and put it into 
   the html for each page. I also resized the original image.
2. Resized the performances images using tinyjpg.com and re-saved into cloud9.
   I adjusted the carousel-inner styles by giving a new height and in addition
   targeted the carousel-inner item image with adjusting the height and margin top.
3. The Facebook icon had a different alignment to the other two links because they were
   classed as img-circle. To amend this issue I removed the margin-top from the 
   img-circle class and I styled the .fa class with vertical-alignment middle.
4. this was a matter of adjusting the media qeuries 
5. To maintain the consistancy of the website the background and navigation was 
   kept the same. To make it more obvious to the user that the webpage has changed
   an opaque animation was added which slides up the page on load. 
6. I found that after a suggestion from one of the mentors that I needed to wrap rows 
   and columns with a container for bootstrap.  I edited the html to ensure that 
   I had containers around my rows. This seemed to adjust some of the layout. 
   I also adjusted the values for the Main properties and this seemed to help 
   reduce the appearance of the jumping when the opaque overlay is being animated.



## Deployment
Site deployed using Github

Initially the background images disappeared when deployed through Github however,
this was rectified with a correction to the image filepath.
