# User Centric Front-end Project- Milestone 1 Naomi Wickham

This website is for the flute and guitar duo “Sidetrack” to showcase their music
and publicise their availability to perform at events. Users can also contact the duo
to enquire about availability or upcoming performances. 

## UX

The duo’s primary target audiences are their “family, friends and other fans” 
who wish to keep abreast of our gigs, past and upcoming. 
They would like to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events
such as weddings, funerals and dinner parties.


They wish to include:
	-Photos of performances
	-Some video clips
	-Some audio clips to demonstrate their diversity of repertoire
	-A list of current repertoires
	-An option to promote additions to the repertoire

In addition, the website should promote live music in Port Adelaide, in particular
	-The Railway Hotel – Port Adelaide
    www.railwayhotelportadelaide.com/
 
	-Michonne Wine Bar: Michonne - Reds, Whites and Bites
    www.michonne.com.au/
